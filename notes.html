            <p>Yes, that's right.  There are only seven notes in music!  They are: A, B, C, D, E, F and G.<br><br>Let's see where each one is placed on a music sheet.</p>

                    <p>The Treble Clef, also known as the G clef, tells us which music line is for which note.  The middle circle of this funny symbol rests on the second line from the bottom, telling us that this line is for the note G.<br><br>Since the Treble Clef is the most comon Clef for beginners, let's pretend that the rest of notes in this lesson are using this squiggly symbol.</p>

            <img src="images/notes.jpg" alt="All notes on the manuscript from Low D to High G">
            <p>Because we are pretending that the treble clef is in front of aaaall these notes, we can see that the note G is on the second last line.  That means that all the other letters are falling in to their place above and below our little G.<br><br>Because musical notes only use the first seven letters of the alphabet, we just repeat them when we run out of letters.  After G, we start from A again as we go up the lines.  If we are going down, we count down from G once we end up at A again.</p>

            <p>Isn't a scale that thing that weighs ingredients?  Well technically yes, but not when it comes to music.<br><br>Scales in music means traveling up and down the notes, and a chord is playing three notes (that are two notes up from each other) at the same time.<br><br>Confused?  Me too.  Let's find out more!</p>

                    <p>If we start from the note lower D and play all the way up to the higher D, we have just gone up the D scale!<br><br>After that, we can travel all the way back down to the lower D note to complete the scale because, just like a balancing scales, a musical scale is supposed to look balanced on the page!</p>

            <p>What happenes if you choose a note that goes outside the lines?  The answer is simple really: just draw more!<br><br>When you try to go lower or higher than the five manuscript lines on the page, it's okay to draw little lines either above or below where the ogriginal five are.  Just make sure that you leave the right amount of lines and spaces to reach the note you want to play.</p>

                    <h2>~Simple Chords~</h2>
                    <p>There is a lot to chords that is a bit too hard to explain just yet.  For now, you can think of chords as notes that are played together and are one note apart from each other.<br><br>In other words, if you want to play an F chord, you take that as your lowest note, skip the next note (which is G by the way) and add on the A note.  Then skip another and add on the C note.<br><br>Here is an example of a D chord to give you an idea of what to do!</p>
